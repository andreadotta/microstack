- Microfrontend: The frontend is developed using Next.js, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.
- Data Modeling: Explore the concepts of data modeling to design efficient and intuitive data structures.
- External API Integration: Learn how to integrate external APIs into your application for enhanced functionality.
- Comprehensive Documentation: The repository includes comprehensive documentation to guide you through the development process.
- Code Examples: Find a collection of code examples that demonstrate best practices and advanced solutions.
